# Test API

## A dummy REST API 

This dummy API is a very (very) basic service made with python, flask, a json file and Gunicorn; and deployed to have an API server for testing purposes of my Holberton final project. You can use this as an example to deploy your own

The API server example is here <https://api-test-rappi.herokuapp.com/users>

the api has currently the following endpoints and method

* GET /status
* GET /users
* GET /users/{string:id} 
* POST /users 
* PUT /users/{string: id}
